# Stardew-File-Converter
A simple script for converting Stardew Valley save files ready to be compressed for Switch, or vice versa.

Save files for Stardew Valley can be transferred between the PC and Nintendo Switch and played on both editions of the game. The save files won't work however if the GameVersion variable within the save file isn't changed to the correct version of the game you're playing on (currently Switch is 1.5.4.1 and PC is 1.5.4). This script automatically detects which save file you have and converts it to make it ready for whatever platform you'll be using it on. It's a very niche application but it's something I have use for and I wanted to challenge myself to create code, as it's something I aspire to do but haven't had much experience in at all.

Currently, the save file still needs to be uncompressed and compressed first via a different application. This feature may be built in at a later date to make this script universal.
